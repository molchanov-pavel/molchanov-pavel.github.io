I am a doctoral candidate in economics at [Aix-Marseille School of Economics](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/fr/membres/molchanov) and will be available for interviews for the 2021-2022 job market. My major research interests are in international trade and labour economics. 

In my works, I use theoretical models to study the impact of trade on firm competition, economies of scale, and gains from trade. My emphasis is on the role of variable markups and firm heterogeneity. Specifically, in my job market paper, I extend a model of monopolistic competition to examine the effect of product market competition on unemployment when markups are non-constant.

I am also a Teaching Assistant in microeconomics (baccalaur√©at level) at Paris-Saclay University for the period of 2020-2022.
