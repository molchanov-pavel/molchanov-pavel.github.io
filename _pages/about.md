I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Center for Market Studies and Spatial Economics in St. Petersburg. I received my PhD at [Aix-Marseille School of Economics](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/fr/membres/molchanov) in 2021. My major research interests are in international trade and labour economics. 

In my works, I use theoretical models to study the impact of trade on firm competition, economies of scale, and gains from trade. My emphasis is on the role of variable markups and firm heterogeneity. Specifically, in my job market paper, I extend a model of monopolistic competition with non-CES preferences to examine the effect of product market competition on unemployment.

I akso serve as the director of the economics track for the masterâ€™s program "Data Analytics for Business and Economics" at [HSE University, Saint-Petersburg](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/data-analytics/) and a lecturer in Microeconomics I and Macroeconomics I at bachelor level for the period of 2022-2024.
